# Course Description
This course will examine the finer points of technical communication and highlight the ways in which these modes of discourse apply to the professional world. English 3130 is an interactive experience of learning to communicate effectively with technical professionals in ways that will allow you to understand important issues that will affect your life and career in a STEM or technical field. 

This course works on the premise that in order to write effectively in any professional situation, you must first explore and understand the demands of that situation. Since no one style, tone of voice, strategy, or approach is applicable to every circumstance or audience, this course will emphasize the development and control of the writing process itself, rather than merely imitate a set and formal approach (e.g. “the cover letter,” “the technical report,” etc.). While we will begin with formal technical writing standards as a jumping off point, you will tailor many of the writing exercises and assignments to your particular field of study.
